## Introduction
The Job Search Portal is a web application that allows users to search for job opportunities and apply for jobs. Along with this users can also post job openings in their institution. The project is built using Angular and Node.js, and it serves as a showcase for software engineering learnings. The repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources related to the project.

1. FRONTEND: This directory contains the Angular frontend code, including components, services, and templates for the user interface of the job search portal.
2. BACKEND: This directory contains the Node.js backend code, including database, and controllers for handling job search and job application functionalities.
3. E2E: This directory contains test cases and test data used for testing the project. Path -> "frontend/layons/e2e"
